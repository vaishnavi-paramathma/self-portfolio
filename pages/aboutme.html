        <h1>About Me</h1><br>
        <h2>I am Vaishnavi Paramathma from Erode. I have a small family of 4 members, my mother,
            father and brother. I am a deep thinker and I love working hard on any kind of project.
            My commitment and dedication to life makes me learn,evaluate, analyze, improve and re-test
            everything I do in life. I am  very much interested in software development and so I joined
            Freshworks Software Academy in 2021 to chase my dreams. Since I like working with new people,
            I make a great team player and a good leader too. Apart from software development,
            drawing,craftworks,reading books and playing games  is what I do when I get bored. 
            I also love meeting new people and having new experiences.
